            <pre>
Hi there!
I’ve always been curious about how things work, and that curiosity has grown into a passion for robotics. 
I'm fascinated by how software and hardware can work together to create smart, 
automated solutions that improve everyday life.

My goal is to combine my programming skills with robotics to build smart systems that solve real-world problems. 
I also look forward to working on collaborative tech projects and internships to grow my experience.

Lately, I’ve been deeply interested in programming and web development. 
I enjoy writing clean code and building simple websites. 
I’m excited to keep learning and applying these skills in meaningful ways.
Although I’m just starting out, I’m committed to continuous learning and hands-on exploration. </pre><br>

<li style="font-family: cursive;"><b>&#10024 What Motivates Me</b></li>
<pre>
I believe that motivation comes from finding strength in both words and music. One quote that 
truly drives me is:

<q><i>I don’t stop when I’m tired. I stop when I’m done.</i></q>

It reminds me to stay determined and keep pushing forward until I achieve what I set out to do.

I also find motivation in music — songs like "Hall of Fame" by The Script and "Grateful" by Neffex keep me 
energized and focused on my goals, especially during challenging times.

<pre>
 Outside of academics, I absolutely love spending time with dogs — they bring me so much joy! 
 I enjoy reading novels, especially emotional and engaging ones that draw me in. 
 Cooking is something I really enjoy; I love trying out new recipes and being creative in the kitchen. 
 I also care about self-care, so I regularly do skin care and hair care routines. 
 To stay fit and healthy, I make time for working out and staying active.
 I also love doing arts — it's one of my favorite ways to relax.
